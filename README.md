# Replica

Replica is a competition organized by the OSS Club of AIT, Pune. This project is my entry for the competition. As a beginner in coding, this is my first project, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## Project Overview
We are given with a png and we have to replicate it using a html and css only. I tried my level best in this. I am a begginer and hence dont know much about industry standards but I have added comments and I have tried to make code as much readable as possible. I have also added Hover effects to make it more attrative and I have used media tag to make a responsive, altough its not completly responsive but I tried my best. I have taken refrence from w3school and notes provided byu the OSS community.
